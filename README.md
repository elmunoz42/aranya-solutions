Nepal Village Livelihood - We are supporting Digam Village's Community Development through agriculture training, livelihood programs and building a community center.  Working with this remote village who was deeply affected by the 2015 Earthquake, a massive 7.6 magnitude that affected most of the country, where homes, schools and communities were destroyed. We will provide programming support and life skill building activities for them to become self sustaining.




    4. b. Leadership & Facilitation
          a. use pic of facilitating from my old site that we will turn into KatrinaZavalney.com... I like those professional photos, this audience is more professional than just community.  (I can't find my pics from that, and don't have access to them)
          b. add in the flyer, attached

Description:
We provide training in leadership development, emotional intelligence, critical thinking and communication skills, compassion and embodied empowerment. We support anyone who wants to gain these skills especially new political leaders, nonprofits, INGO’s and community leaders interested in increasing their leadership skills. We will collaborate with partners in Nepal, India and other countries. We appreciate donors to provide scholarships for those in need to receive leadership training.



We also promote leadership that inspires through podcasts, interviews, social media, and our innovation labs.




     4.c. Innovation Labs
           a. use group event photo attached (not sure if it is copywrited... however I think it is safe to use now as a placeholder)
Description:
Events and think-tanks that lead to action plans and solutions for climate change and humanitarian issues to further drive innovation and awareness. We give voice to change makers and learn from the experience and wisdom of thought leaders in the areas we serve and around the world.  

We look for leaders in sustainability, humanity, technology, consciousness expansion and equity conversations. The innovation labs result in concise action plans and solutions for climate change and humanitarian issues. Through this we establish groups and a network to further drive action, innovation and awareness on an ongoing basis. These Innovation Labs will happen throughout the world, kicking off in the United States over the summer of 2018 in cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, etc.  



     4.d. Mindful Movement
           a. use pic attached
           b. video (coming)
Description:
Mindful movement is to gently move the body with conscious, refreshing movements. This program is designed for conferences, trainings and workshops that would like to incorporate activity where people can move their bodies and get a little exercise. The moves bring in awareness of the body and mindfulness in life. Group sessions for organizations or communities are always welcome to book a session to support your people be more energized, refreshed and focused - great for team building!



5. Landing Page / home page
a. Move the mission statement up under the quote. Let's move the video down to the current projects section at the end of the main page. I don't think the video is high quality enough to keep there. (When we have a nice, high quality video we can put there). Now that people will be looking at our website, we need to define who we are more upfront.

b. Move up the Village Community Support and Leadership descriptions, put the leadership description first then village. (As we have a grant in for leadership training & the new flyer going out then we need to put that up front).
    a. Change the Leadership description to: " Our focus is to empower leaders to come forward with renewed confidence in their capacity to make a positive change in their community, organizations and life"

c. Move the scrolling image of the mountains to after the Village description.

d. at the end of the page with Current Projects, add that we work in collaboration with partner organizations ICA Nepal, Relief Trust and the Rotary Club (ICA Nepal isn't listed there)
