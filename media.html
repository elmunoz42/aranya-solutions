        <h3>Our media and communications platform helps create the conditions for sustainability by nurturing an ecosystem of vibrant lasting relationships between our stakeholders, supporters and network of pollinators and leaders. The goal is for this living web of meaningful relationships to support the rise of a more connected, compassionate, and culturally diverse world.</h3>

      <div class="checklist">
        <h3>Our communications platform encompasses:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Sharing the Stories from the Villages:</em> Videos, pictures, articles, blogs and social media. Focused on the villagers we work with in Nepal. We will give the villagers support through a platform to tell their story, their successes and struggles.</li>
          <li><em>Involving a Community of Supporters:</em> Special videos and live updates from the field for engaging donors in the work they are supporting. We want to help our supporters experience the meaning of the work they are funding that want to make a difference by supporting our mission with funds, resources and awareness of global humanitarian issues.</li>
          <li><em>Promoting Leadership that Inspires:</em> Interviews with people who inspire us, shared in videos, stories and innovation labs. We give voice to change makers and learn from the experience and wisdom of thought leaders in the areas we serve and around the world.</li>

       </div>
       <p>We serve as a platform that
       amplifies the voice of those who are not being heard. People in the areas
       missed by scale gaps are all to often not being seen or recognized by local
       governments, nonprofits, and International Organizations (INGO’s).

       <br>
       By defining
       these villagers’ experience and story we give them a voice and raise awareness
       about their needs, culture and offerings to their region and communities
       beyond.  The goal is to raise the
       visibility for the villagers in such a way that it will attract potential
       partnerships, funding and beneficial livelihood opportunities. Aranya Solutions
       acts as a pollinator creating a web of relationships to help bridge resources
       needed in these communities.
       <br>
       See the video below made by our partners, The Relief Trust, for the village we are helping share their voice, needs and desires. We are working with this community to support their livelihood through an array of trainings and development they have asked for.</p>

        <p>We have a village rebuilding project in Nepal, Digam Village. In this video you can hear the voices of the villagers, their needs and an introduction to where we work. We are creating an array of services to meet these needs with education, agriculture, health and working with them to build a community center. <a href="/digam-village-project.html">Click here for more information on this project.</a></p>
