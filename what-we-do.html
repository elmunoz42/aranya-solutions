            <p style="margin-bottom: 58px;">We are currently working with The Relief Trust of Nepal, and the Rotary Club to bring meaningful relief to the people of Digam village. This village suffered greatly from the 2015 earthquake and hasn't gotten the help it needs to prosper and be prepared for any coming setbacks. We also provide leadership training to help create the next generation of change makers and consulting services for development organizations. Additionally, we offer Mindful Movement classes and curate inspirational think tank events called "Innovation Labs". Learn more about these projects and our wholistic approach to empower these corageous people. </p>

            <p style="padding-bottom: 23px;">
              We will work with those that align with the values of Sustainable Land Use, Community Development and Sustainable Solutions locally and globally. <br> <br>The project must align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and bring positive impact to the environment and people. It is important that the work will not bring harm to people, animals or the planet.

            <h3>Our Ethos – “Service Above Self”</h3>
            <p>
              We use an action research process in an informal interview setting for participants to be relaxed and offer honest answers on issues related to the target area. We then assist organizations/ communities to develop a structure to more efficiently meet their needs. Most things will be done in partnership and collaboration where Aranya Solutions acts a bridge to resources and infrastructure.

              We believe that for service to be true it must also be embodied, and thus connected with our whole being. This is the leading edge of the sustainability movement: the realization that no matter how many solar panels we install, how many green products we consume, how much CO2 [and Methane] we remove from the atmosphere, we will not be living better lives if we do not transform ourselves, our lifestyles, choices and priorities. Sustainability is an inside job, a learning journey to live lightly, joyfully, peacefully, meaningfully.
