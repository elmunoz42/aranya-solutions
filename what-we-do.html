            <h2>Current Projects:</h2>
            <p>We are currently working with The Relief Trust of Nepal, and the Rotary Club to bring meaningful relief to the people of Digam village. This village suffered greatly from the 2015 earthquake and hasn't gotten the help it needs to prosper and be prepared for any coming setbacks. Additionally, we also provide leadership training to help create the next generation of change makers and consulting services for development organizations. Learn more about these projects and our wholistic approach to empower these corageous people.</p>

            <h3>Our Ethos – “Service Above Self”</h3>
            <p>
              We use an action research process in an informal interview setting for participants to be relaxed and offer honest answers on issues related to the target area. We then assist organizations/ communities to develop a structure to more efficiently meet their needs. Most things will be done in partnership and collaboration where Aranya Solutions acts a bridge to resources and infrastructure.

              We believe that for service to be true it must also be embodied, and thus connected with our whole being. This is the leading edge of the sustainability movement: the realization that no matter how many solar panels we install, how many green products we consume, how much CO2 [and Methane] we remove from the atmosphere, we will not be living better lives if we do not transform ourselves, our lifestyles, choices and priorities. Sustainability is an inside job, a learning journey to live lightly, joyfully, peacefully, meaningfully.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>We serve as a path to co-liberation.
              </li>
              <li>We strive to embody sustainability.</li>
              <li>We connect respectfully and humbly with our stakeholders.</li>
              <li>We celebrate and build out from strengths.</li>
              <li>We celebrate and follow inspiration and curiosity.</li>
              <li>We don’t reinvent the wheel.</li>
              <li>We fill the gaps and connect.</li>
              <li>We don’t impose change.</li>
