            <h3>What Aranya Means:</h3>
            <p>
              Aranya means "Bountiful Forest" in Sanskrit. It signifies plentitude, generosity, resources, and prosperity. We believe there are enough resources to go around and we can help identify the resources for abundance, pollinate like bees!<br>
              Aranya delivers a sense of responsibility, love, and balance. We are ever helpful, conscientious, and quite capable of recifying inharmonious situations. Aranya is devoted to the betterment of community and ecology with a depth of understanding that evokes sympathy, kindness, and generosity. Openness and honesty are apparent in Arayna's approach to all relations.

            <h3>Our Story:</h3>
            <p>
              This nonprofit is being formed to fill an important niche of working directly with the community in collaboration with local organizations and providing leadership development skills for long term public health and sustainability. The purpose of having a nonprofit in the USA is to raise funds from the States to bring to places that are in greater need, as a direct channel for fundraising efforts for maximum impact.<br>

              Aranya Solutions is a nonprofit registered in the state of Montana 2018 and we are recognized as a 501 (c) (3) organization. We formed a nonprofit to serve the under served, starting our work in Nepal after seeing the needs for more support on the ground and for fundraising.  Aranya Solutions serves organizations and communities dedicated to making the world a better place. We create and facilitate strategies for efficiency.<br>

              We successfully completed the needs assessment for the Digam Village Community Development project in the Fall of 2017. We developed a calendar of activities for 2018 for programs to meet the needs of the village assessed. We identified programs for the next 4 years for agriculture, education, health, leadership and community development.<br>

            <h3>Our Ethos – “Service Above Self”</h3>
            <p>
              We believe that for service to be true it must also be embodied, and thus connected with our whole being. This is the leading edge of the sustainability movement: the realization that no matter how many solar panels we install, how many green products we consume, how much CO2 [and Methane] we remove from the atmosphere, we will not be living better lives if we do not transform ourselves, our lifestyles, choices and priorities. Sustainability is an inside job, a learning journey to live lightly, joyfully, peacefully, meaningfully.
